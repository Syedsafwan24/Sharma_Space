Compare 2 files @C:\Users\Syeds\Downloads\SharmaSpace - Copy\app\data\blogPosts.js and the files in the folder @C:\Users\Syeds\Downloads\SharmaSpace - Copy\app\data\blog make it one file merged of these 2 such that both the admin dashboard and user view components should use one datafile but the content which is now rendering should not be changed either styling 

3. Compare these 2 files for projects or portfolio section @C:\Users\Syeds\Downloads\SharmaSpace - Copy\app\data\projects.json and C:\Users\Syeds\Downloads\SharmaSpace - Copy\app\data\portfolio make it one file merged of these 2 such that both the admin dashboard and user view components should use one datafile but the content which is now rendering should not be changed either styling

@C:\Users\Syeds\Downloads\SharmaSpace - Copy\app\data\testimonials and 
@C:\Users\Syeds\Downloads\SharmaSpace - Copy\app\data\testimonialsData.js make it one file merged of these 2 such that both the admin dashboard and user view components should use one datafile but the content which is now rendering should not be changed either styling
